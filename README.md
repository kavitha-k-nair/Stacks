# Stacks
Implementation of stack without using built-in functions and using capacity.

Initial size of stack would be a constant value which gets doubled when extra element are added to it. A stack overflow message will not be diplayed, because if it exceeds the stack size during insertion of additional element, then the size of the stack gets doubled.
